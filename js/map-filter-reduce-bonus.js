// PROBLEM 2 - create array of user objects based on the customers array
// of objects (each user object should just have name and age properties)

// PROBLEM 3 - create an array of civil servant customers (teachers and police officers)
// containing the same properties as the objects on the customers objects
// PROBLEM 4 - determine the average age of customers
